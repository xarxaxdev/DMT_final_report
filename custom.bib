	abstract = {This paper presents the results of a quantitative analysis of recycle and replacement self-repairs in English, Hebrew and German. The analysis revealed patterns of similarities and differences across the languages. Beginning with patterns of difference, we found first that English and Hebrew speakers engage in simple recycling about two-thirds of the time, while German speakers make less frequent use of simple recycling. Second, we found that English speakers frequently recycle back to the subject pronoun of a clause, while Hebrew and German speakers make much less use of subject pronoun as a destination of recycling. Third, we found that Hebrew and German speakers recycle back to prepositions much more frequently than do English speakers. With regard to similarities across the three languages, we noted that all three languages used function words as destinations of recycling more often than content words, while replacing content words at a disproportionately high rate. We claimed that entrenched word order patterns play a crucial role in explaining the facts we have observed; patterns of morphological dependence across collocates also shape self-repair practices in these languages. This study is thus further evidence of the shaping role that morpho-syntactic resources have on the self-repair practices of a speech community.}

	abstract = {Current evidence about the persistence of syntactic priming effects (Bock, 1986) is equivocal: Using spoken picture description, Bock and Griffin (2000) found that it persisted over as many as 10 trials; using written sentence completion, Branigan, Pickering, and Cleland (1999) found that it dissipated if even a single sentence intervened between prime and target. This paper asks what causes it to be long lasting. On one account, the rapid decay evidenced by Branigan et al. occurs because the task emphasizes conceptual planning; on another account, it is due to the written nature of their task. If conceptual planning is the cause, this might relate to planning the prime sentence or planning an intervening sentence. Hence we conducted an experiment with spoken sentence completion, contrasting no delay, an intervening sentence, and a pure temporal delay. The results indicated that strong and similar priming occurred in all three cases, therefore lending support to the claim that spoken priming is long lasting.},
